# Forward March, by Roy Awesome

Forward March is a 3v3 autobattler inspired by Direct Strike for Warcraft 3, built in the Godot Engine.


The goal of this game is to become a Discord Activity or Web game.  A desktop version may be built but im not gunning for that.


## CONTRIBUTING

Pull Requests are welcome!  Due to the requirement to be built in WASM and for web platforms, all game features must be written in a way that can be compiled for that platform.  This means using gdscript.

All artistic contributions must be in an open license, such as CC-BY-SA, CC-BY-NC, any combination of those, or any other open license.  Please **VERY CLEARLY** document the asset and license in the ASSET-LICENSES file!  That's also where attribution will go!

The game code is open source and permissively licensed under a dual Apache 2.0 or MIT license.  You may chose either license 

This dual licensing approach provides a few benefits:

* Apache 2.0 provides protection from patent trolling, and reduces license boilerplate
* MIT is compatible with many other open source licenses
* Both licenses have various ecosystems to support them
